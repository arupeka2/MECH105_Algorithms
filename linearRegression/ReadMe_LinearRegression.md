# Linear Regression Algorithm
## This is a program that with inputs x and y calculates the linear regression for the data sets. It calculates the a1 and a0 values for the equation y = a1x + a0 as well as the r squared value. In order to make the line as accurate as possible, it also eliminates all outliers that are in the data set using IQR calculations.
### Inputs
- x
- y
### Outputs
- fX
- fY
- a0
- a1
- Rsquared
