# Special Matrix Algorithm
This function allows you to to have a matrix with dimensions as follows: This is a matrix with dimensions n by m where the matrix has a first row from 1 to m, first column from 1 to n, and the rest of the elements where the row above and the row to the left added together equal the value of a specific position in the matrix.
### **Inputs**
- n
- m
### **Outputs**
- A
