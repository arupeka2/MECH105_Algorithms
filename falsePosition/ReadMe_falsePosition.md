# False Position Algorithm
This algorithm estimates the root of a given function using inputs func (the function being evaluated), xl (the lower guess), xu (the upper guess), es (the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%)), and maxit (the maximum number of iterations to use (should default to 200)). It also outputs the root location (fx), the approximate relative error (ea), and iter (how many iterations were performed).
### **Inputs**
- func
- xl
- xu
- es
- maxit
### **Outputs**
- root
- fx
- ea
- iter
