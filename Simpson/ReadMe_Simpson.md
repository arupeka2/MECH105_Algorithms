# Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm
This algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to calculate the numerical integral of a data sets. Using inputs of the vector with equally spaced independent variable (x) and the vector of function values with respect to x (y), it calculates this integral (I). It also uses Trapezoidal Rule if there are only two points and if there are an uneven amount of points, it will use Trapezoidal rule for the last two points.
### **Inputs**
- x
- y 
### **Outputs**
- I
